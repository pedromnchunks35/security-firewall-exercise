# TASK 2 (SERVER SETUP)
![Centos intallation 6.x](task2.1-ServerSetup/2-Centos.png)

1. Install FTP service
- Installation of FTP service

![Install FTP](task2.1-ServerSetup/2-InstallFtpService.png)

![Install FTP2](task2.1-ServerSetup/2-InstallFtpService2.png)

- Enabling httpd

![Enabling httpd](task2.1-ServerSetup/httpdEnable.png)

- Enabling sshd

![Enabling httpd](task2.1-ServerSetup/httpdEnable.png)

- Enabling vsftpd

![Enabling vsftpd](task2.1-ServerSetup/vsftpdEnable.png)

- Starting the Services
  
![Start](task2.1-ServerSetup/Start.png)

- We runned the command 'netstat -l | grep "tcp"'
![Running services](task2.1-ServerSetup/listenServices.png)
- We forgot to start every service, we only had them enabled but we needed to start them all
![Running Services](task2.1-ServerSetup/listelAllServices.png)
- We noticed that the ftp service was up
- Also that the ssh service was up
- And also that http service was up
- Next step has making connections to that services
 
![Http connection](task2.1-ServerSetup/httpService.png)

- The Http Connection was made via browser using "http://localhost", it is a normal website
 
![Ftp Connection](task2.1-ServerSetup/ftpService.png)

- The Fttp Connection was made via browser using "ftp://localhost", it is a service for uploading files

![Chang password](task2.1-ServerSetup/passwordChange.png)

![Ssh Connection](task2.1-ServerSetup/sshConnect.png)

- The ssh connection was made by console and since we are in virtualBox, we needed to change the user password to correctly type the password to enter the service as you can see in the image
- SSH is to remotely have access to the computer console
1. Executing the command "system-config-firewall-tui"

![Executing the command system-config-firewall-tui](task2.1-ServerSetup/firewallConfigScreen.png )

- We enable the firewall and then press OK 
- Later we confirm the new configuration, which will lead to a blue screen that disappears after a few secounds

![Confirmation of the firewall config](task2.1-ServerSetup/confirmFireWallConfig.png)

3. Execute iptables -L -v

![Ip tables rules](task2.1-ServerSetup/ipTablesRules.png)
First of all we need to know that:
- "iptables -L -v" command on linux is used to list the current firewall rules in the iptables packet filtering system, along with packet and byte counters for each rule.
- It shows the Chains which can be either Input,Output and Forward. Input, means that the rules are being applyied to the incoming network traffic destined for the local system(they determine if we accept or reject incoming connections to the local system). Output, means that the rules are being applyied to the outgoing packets (The packets considered are responses). Finally forward, means that the rules are being applyied to the traffic that is not meant for you, which passes by you for you to forward to another machine (Ex: Another machine sending a message to a Virtual Machine that is placed inside your computer, you computer will be something like a router that is passing out the message between the 2 entities which in this case are the external machine that does not make part of the network that you have with your virtual machine and the virtual machine itself)
- The chain itself can have a policy of ACCEPT, REJECT and DROP but rules inside of the chain prevail in relation to this policy
- Also, we have another kind of information which is displayed by chains such as: pkts (Number of packets that have matched a specific rule since the counters were last reset), bytes (Total size of the packets in bytes that have matched the rule since the counters were last reset), target (The action that will succed upon taking the rule matching which can be ACCEPT when accepted, REJECT when rejected and intended to return a error message and DROP when rejected without confirming that it got rejected), prot (This is the protocol which can be TCP,UDP,ICMP,etc..), opt (Which refers to additional options and flags associated with each rule), in (which is the interface from where the packet will be transmited), out (which is the interface for where the packet will be transmited), source(The source ip of the transmition), destination(The destination ip of the transmition) and also a empty header which stands for additional information
- By analyzing the image we can see that: For chain INPUT we have 5 rules. 
- Rule number one got 132 "pkts", 11992 bytes of size and it becomes accepted when it matches the following rules: all protocols match, when the "in" and "out" headers that mean interfaces are anything, the "source" and "destination" are anywhere and when the connection represents connections that were already maded previously accordinly to the aditional information "state RELATED,ESTABLISHED". 
- Rule number two got 0 "pkts", 0 bytes of size and it becomes accepted when it matches the following rules: the prot is "ICMP", "in" and "out" are anything and "source" and "destination" are everywhere.
- Rule number three got 1 "pkts", 184 bytes of size and gets accepted when it matches the following rules: all protocols, when the "in" is "lo", out anything and "source" and "destination" comes from everywhere.
- Rule number four got 0 "pkts", 0 bytes of size and gets accepted when it matches the following rules: protocol is "udp", "in" and "out" are anything, "source" is anywhere, "destination" is on ip "224.0.0.251" and additional information is "state NEW udp dpt:mdns" which stands for representing a rule that matches incoming UDP packets with a destination port (dpt) of mdns. "mdns" refers to multicast DNS, which is used for service discovery in local networks. This rule is likely allowing incoming multicast DNS traffic.
- Rule number five got 0 "pkts", 0 bytes of size and gets rejected everytime it the following rules: anykind of protocol, anykind of "in" interface and "out" interface, anytime it get source and destination from anywhere and its additional information is "reject-with icmp-host-prohibited", which stands for the action to be taken when a packet matches the rule. In this case, the action is to reject the packet and send an ICMP "host-prohibited" message back to the sender. This is a common rejection message used to indicate that the destination host does not accept the incoming connection.
- In case of the Chain FORWARD, we have only one rule.
- This rule has 0 "pkts", 0 bytes of size and gets rejected anytime when the following rules match: anykind of protocols, "in" and "out" are anything,"source" and "destination" are anywhere and the aditional information stands for sending a "icmp-host-prohibited" message. 
- In the case of the Chain OUTPUT, it does not have anykind of rule
![Network interface](task2.1-ServerSetup/interface-network.png)
- In terms of security as you can see, we connected the host to the machine via a bridged adapter
- 
![Ip address](task2.1-ServerSetup/ip-show.png)
- By doing ip show in the centos we can see that the ip address inside the host network is 192.168.1.139
- We can even ping the machine
![Ping machine](task2.1-ServerSetup/ping-machine.png)
- Despite the ability to ping it, we do not have access to any of the services displayed previously, shuch as ssh, http and ftp

![shh attempt](task2.1-ServerSetup/ssh-not-working.png)

![http attempt](task2.1-ServerSetup/http-does-not-work.png)

![ftp with curl](task2.1-ServerSetup/ftp-curl-in-centos.png)

- As you can see we can see the content of our ftp server in the machine but in the host machine we cannot
  
![ftp with curl in host](task2.1-ServerSetup/ftp-not-working.png)

- This attemps correspond to the INPUT Chain, which are the incoming requests

![input with the ip show comparation](task2.1-ServerSetup/conclude-security-ip-tables.png)
- Answering to the question of security, i think that the level is good. The rules that take effect are the ones that match first, so as we can see in the image upper when i try to make contact from outside the machine i will always be denied, atleast if i don't use icmp protocol or i am a service discovery.
- Denote that the first rule is only for already established connections 
- Also, note that you only can make connections locally because you have a rule that only enables you to do so in the "lo" interface, which is localhost where the host machine does not make apart of, it only makes part of the eth0 which stands for ethernet network interface provided by the bridge adapter that links the wlo to the machine
- Icmp is enable ,thats why i can ping the machine and i cannot access other services

![Rejected wireshark](task2.1-ServerSetup/rejected-wireshark.png)
- As you can see, when we try to access using the host machine it throws the error given by the the additional information on the iptables rules. This information was given by wireshark
  
![Allowing ssh connection](task2.1-ServerSetup/enable-ssh-last.png)
- In order to make our life easier we made a connection by ssh to the machine throught the host
- To enable ssh we added the rule before the rule of rejection, because if we added after, it would match the reject rule first
- To do this we used the command "sudo iptables -I INPUT 1 -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT"
- "-I INPUT 1" for inserting in the position 1
- "-i eth0" to put the rule to allow the request to come from eth0 interface
- "-p tcp" to allow the protocol tcp
- "--dport 22" to allow at port 22 because it is the port of the ssh
- "-j ACCEPT", to make it ACCEPT in those conditions 
![SHH linkage](task2.1-ServerSetup/acessing-ssh-after-allowing.png)
- Now we can for sure link the ssh protocol as you can see in the image above.. for the simplicity we will pursue using the machine by ssh because of comodity
 
![Tables save](task2.1-ServerSetup/save-table.png)
- As you can see we saved our tables in a file caled iptables.dump

![Empty the table](task2.1-ServerSetup/empty-table.png)

- Now empty the tables

![Restore the table](task2.1-ServerSetup/restore-table.png)

- This is how we restored the table out

![Disable firewall](task2.1-ServerSetup/disable-firewall.png)
- In this step we disable the firewall
  
![Rules after turning the firewall off](task2.1-ServerSetup/rulesAfterFirewall.png)

- If we turn the firewall of, we stop having the rules that we once had. This becomes very dangerous because, we will not filter any kind of request, which can be something critical with some kind of services that we may have.
  
![Enable firewall again](task2.1-ServerSetup/enable-firewall-again.png)

- We enable firewall again

![Rules are back](task2.1-ServerSetup/table-is-back-after-firewall-up.png)

- Rules are back after firewall restored

# TASK 2.2 (CLIENT SETUP)
![Ping server](task2.2-ClientSetup/ping-server.md)

- We setted a client with black arch linux, where we pinged the server machine

![Client interface details](task2.2-ClientSetup/client-interface-details.png)
![Server interface details](task2.2-ClientSetup/server-interface-details.png)
- These are both client and server network interface details

![nmap](task2.2-ClientSetup/nmap.png)
- We made a nmap check into the server host. Since the machine rules don't expose any of the services we activated in the previous tasks, we got no information about opened ports. 

![nmap with more flags](task2.2-ClientSetup/nmap-aditional-opts.png)
- After reading some of the docs, we provided the flags "-p0- -v -A"
- "-p0-" flag is intended to scan every single port of the target
- "-v", print version number of the service we are attacking
- "-A", it is for the OS detection
- The output displayed says "Completed NSE at 17:07", because it is confirming that the script was used

![w3m](task2.2-ClientSetup/w3m.png)
- We runned "w3m" against the server
- Since the machine has rules that stop us to access the http server that we have on that machine, we were unable to execute the command

![ftp](task2.2-ClientSetup/ftp.png)
- We runned "ftp" against the server
- We also cannot access this service because of the server rules

![ssh](task2.2-ClientSetup/ssh.png)

- We runned "ssh" against the server 
- We also cannot access this server because of the server rules
- We cannot access any of this services because of the rules settet previously, like we said and since these are incoming request this means we will be using the INPUT Chain rules. If we look again to the table we note that, since the behavior is to use the rule that matches first the given request, the request will only go to a different rule when the protocol is ICMP, which is the protocol used for the ping command (the only operation we could do). Other requests besides this and a request for service discovery, will be denied by the last rule which matches every request that we can possible make, since it reaches every protocol, every interface and every source and destination. 
# 2.3- Fine Tune
![trust ftp](task2.3-Fine-tune/trust-ftp.png)

![trust ssh](task2.3-Fine-tune/trust-ssh.png)

![trust http](task2.3-Fine-tune/trust-www.png)

- In this step we go again to "system-config-firewall-tui" > customize and trust every service that we previously activated (ftp,ssh and http)

![give all access to a certain network](task2.3-Fine-tune/trust-in-interface-network.png)
- This is the window where you can select a interface to give full access

![mask a interface](task2.3-Fine-tune/mask-interface-network.png)
- This is the window to mask the interface out, which tells you the range of ips that you can have in the subnetwork

![Port forwarding](task2.3-Fine-tune/ip-forward-interface-network.png)
- This window is to create a tunneling between 2 systems

![ICMB filter](task2.3-Fine-tune/ICMP-filtered-commands.png)
- Which components of the ICMB will be filtered by the firewall
- In this window we selected all besides the Echo Request (ping) like instructed

![Custom rules](task2.3-Fine-tune/custom-rules.png)
- This is the window of the custom-rules

![After Custom Rules](task2.3-Fine-tune/afterCustomRules.png)
- Those are the rules generated by the custom rules
- The statement says for ping the server after this, which we did but the response is exacly the same because the host is rejecting incoming requests such as: echo-reply, destination-unreachable, parameter-problem, redirect, router-advertisement, router-solicitation, source-quench and time-exceeded. So, in that behalf i still can do a ping to the machine because they are allowing it and also because it is a echo-request and not a echo-reply.

![Echo request](task2.3-Fine-tune/echo-request.png)
- As you can see in this image, the only upcoming request that the host receives (192.168.1.139) is a echo-request
- The echo-reply is a outgoing

![Ftp Success](task2.3-Fine-tune/w3m-sucess.png)
- We tryied w3m for acessing a website via cmd and we achiedved to link to the website of the CentOS

![Ftp Success](task2.3-Fine-tune/ftp-success.png)
- After trying to use ftp, we now see that we can make a connection to it despite not beeing able to login

![namp custom rules](task2.3-Fine-tune/nmap-with-custom-rules.png)
- With nmap we now can see which services are open and in which ports they are open
- Comparing to the last try, we whould notice that we could't extract any information before and now we can
![nmapfull1](task2.3-Fine-tune/nampfull1.png)
![nmapfull2](task2.3-Fine-tune/nmapfull2.png)
![nmapfull3](task2.3-Fine-tune/nmapfull3.png)
- This is the nmap with more options where we could get some ways to break into some of the services, their versions and also we can see some information about the OS.

![ping client from server](task2.3-Fine-tune/ping-client-from-server.png)
- This is the ping maded from the host(server) to the client
- Answering to the question that if i would expect such behavior Yes, because altought we have a rule to deny echo reply's, we still have a rule above that accepts every request which we made a connection previously (the first rule)

![custom rules](task2.3-Fine-tune/afterCustomRules.png)
- Answering to question 8, the last activities that we done have been sucessfully acomplished because of the the custom rules that we setted previously. First, pinging from the client to the server is achieved sucessfully because like i said we reject echo reply's, but not echo requests which are then enabled more ahead (with the allowance of the ICMP protocols to every interface and from anywhere to anywhere) and since the first rule to apply is the one to execute this operation will be sucessfull. Secound, w3m service is enabled because we allowed it alost at the hand. Third, nmap will now be able to get all the 3 services that we enabled, that you can see in the rules that will be acessible. Finaly, pinging from the server machine to the client will be just fine, since we enable all the connections in all protocols, from anywhere to anywhere and in all the interfaces in the first rule, so it will not be a problem despite receiving a incoming packet echo reply. We would only be denied if the client sent a echo reply request without a echo request request.
# 2.4 Writing rules
![delete rules](task2.4-wiringRules/EraseTables.png)
- At 2.4 we erased the ip table

![New rules](task2.4-wiringRules/new-rules.png)

- Those are the new rules, which default policies are DROP
- INPUT and OUTPUT chains where the linkage were already maded are accepted everytime for every protocol, to every interface, from and to everywhere.
- Every operation in LO either OUTPUT and INPUT are accepted
- DHCP is enabled in the RULE D, by enabling udp to OUTPUT channel with destiny ports 67:68 and source ports 67:68
- For dns we enabled either tcp and udp for destiny port 53 in both to output chain
- For ssh we enabled port 22 ,with in "eth0" and also with protocol tcp to input chain
- For Http we did the same but for port 80 to input chain
- For Https we did the same but for port 443 to input chain
- For SMTP we accepted port 25 to output chain
- For NTP we accepted port 123 to output chain

![Now we restore](task2.4-wiringRules/restore.png)
- In this step we restore the table with the configurations we created previously

![New rules 2](task2.4-wiringRules/new-rules-2.png)
- These is the result from the rules above

![dhcp reset](task2.4-wiringRules/dhcp-restore.png)
- We reseted the network service and we still get correctly the automatically self-given ip address from eth0, so dhcp its working just fine

![dns](task2.4-wiringRules/dns-reset.png)
- Also, after a quick research on the internet, we founded how to flush the dns cache
- After doing so, we still be enabled to ping the host of google.com

# 3 Tasks - fw (advanced)
![configuration 1](task3-fw/configuration1.png)
![configuration 2](task3-fw/configuration2.png)
- To start this task, i installed the pfSense image in a debian linux machine 64 bits
- Before initializating it, i made a configuration at network level, enabling bridge adapter in the first adapter to wlo1 and in the secound adapter i enabled a internal network called "network-dacasa"

![configuration 3](task3-fw/configuration3.png)
- Also, we changed the type to paravirtualized network (virtio-net) and the promiscuous mode got changed to allow vms

![configuration 4](task3-fw/configuration4.png)
- For the other 2 machines, more precisely the centOS 6.9 (The machine that served as server in the last chapter) and black arch linux (the machine that served as client in the last chapter), we configured the network to be exacly as the secound adapter in the "firewall" named machine.

![pfSense Installation](task3-fw/pfSense-Installation.png)
- We installed pfSense in the virtual box with the default options provided by a website
- The machine has 10gb of internal memory, 1gb of ram and 2 processors
- When installing we selected the keyboard we wanted to, which in my case is spanish because why not
- Then it asks how do you want to install it in terms of memory and i selected the secound option which auto partitions the memory and do not bothers me at all
- It downloads what it needs and then it asks if i want to log into the console which i do not want
- Finally it asks for reboot

![pfSense interface selection](task3-fw/pf-sense-interface-choose.png)
- As you can see, on entrance it asks which interfaces i want
- For the first option (WAN), i selected the bridge adapter (em0)
- For the secound option (LAN), i selected the internal network

![Ips](task3-fw/ips.png)
- These is the atribbuted ips 
- For the WAN, as expected the ipv4 is 192.168.1.143
- For the LAN, we have the ip address as 192.168.1.1

![network-lan-configuration](task3-fw/network-configuration.png)
- We configured the ip address of the LAN network, in order to put the LAN in a different network of the WAN. We setled the previous IPV4 (192.168.1.1) to another subnet IPV4(192.168.2.1), with of course 24 bits for the submask, with ip ranges of 192.168.2.1-192.168.2.20 which should be more than enought since we only have 3 machines and we enabled the DHCP.

![Network config ok for black arch linux](task3-fw/config-show.png)
- As you can see after setting the configuration above, after restarting the network manager in the black arch linux we are able to have automatically the ip address assigned by the network (192.168.2.2)

![Network config ok for centos](task3-fw/config-show2.png)
- The same goes to our centOS 6.9 machine, which after restarting the network manager we got the new automatically generated ip address (192.168.2.3)

![full check blackarch](task3-fw/black-arch-internet-pings.png)
- As you can see we have access to all the machines within the network but we cannot access the internet, in the black arch linux

![CentOS6.9](task3-fw/centOS6.9.png)
- As you can see we have access to all machines but not to the internet in the centos machine

![Pfsense blackarch](task3-fw/pfsense-black-arch.png)
![Pfsense centos](task3-fw/pf-sense-centos.png)
![Pfsense internet](task3-fw/pf-sense-google.png)
- The pfsense has access to the machines and also the internet

![Solving problem](task3-fw/internet-problem-solved.png)
- After we encountered the internet communication issue, we went into the pfsense documentation
- It said for us to loggin in the web interface using the LAN pfsense ip address (192.168.2.1)
- The username is "admin", the password is "pfsense"
- After further analysis and a lot of digging, we founded that in the rules section for wan, we had 2 rules blocking connections to private networks and bogon networks
- After disable this rules, we successfully had internet connection in either the black arch linux and also the centOS

![blackarch-linux internet](task3-fw/back-arch-internet-connection.png)
![centos internet](task3-fw/centos-internet-connection.png)
- As you can see we solved the problem for both machines, now we have plenty access to the internet :)
- Unfortenelly, we solved the problem and the comment to the default settings was not made because we tought that the internet connection has required
- In the default options in the WAN section the options selected were block private networks and bogon networks
- In case of block private networks, that would block private networks such as "172.16.0.0/12", "192.168.0.0/16" and "192.168.2.0/24" (this is ours). Which got us forbidden of access the internet in our LAN machines.
- In case of block bogon networks, that would block networks such as "192.0.2.0/24", networks that are supposely just for testing purposes and enviroments.
- This settings are good if we want to block the lan machines from accessing the internet from the WAN 
# Impeding access to a website
![getting ip ranges](task3-fw/getting-ip-ranges.png)
- We got the ip ranges for facebook from blackarch

![Calculation of CIDR](task3-fw/calculation-finished.png)
- We searched for a website that calculates the CIDR from the ip addresses and this was the result

![Black arch facebook access](task3-fw/black-arch-facebook.png)
- Access to the facebook page from black arch linux

![Firewall Rules](task3-fw/Lan-rules.png)
- We went to firewall > Rules > LAN as instructed

![Creation of new rule](task3-fw/rule1.png)
- We created an new rule where we reject TCP

![Creation of new rule 1.2](task3-fw/rule1.2.png)
- We also put the option of source to LAN net to the option becoming enabled from the LAN net

![Creation of new rule 2](task3-fw/rule2.png)
- We putted the destination options as the destination be the network and the CIDR is the one that we calculated in the previous website (157.240.0.0/16)

![Creation of new rule 3](task3-fw/rule3.png)
- We also enabled logs and give a description to the rule
- After that we saved the options and applied the changes :)

![Facebook nok](task3-fw/facebook-not-ok.png)
![Facebook nok centos](task3-fw/facebook-nok-centos.png)
- After the rule taking effect, it becomes impossible to access the facebook

![State](task3-fw/states.png)
